# WORKSPACE - Flatiron School Software Engineering Program Capstone Project

Workspace is a productivity app to help manage all the various assets related to design projects. It is built using a React frontend and a Ruby on Rails backend utilizing a Postgres database. I mainly used React Styled Components for CSS, with a little Bootstrap 5 thrown in for fun. And navigation.

- React.js frontend

  - Styled-Components for main CSS styling
  - Bootstrap 5 for navigation
  - Axios and Fetch for third-party API handling

- Ruby on Rails backend
  - Active Record
  - Active Storage for uploading and storing images
  - BCrypt for password handling
  - Postgresql@14 database

Check out a quick walkthrough [demo here](https://www.loom.com/share/e36d19a001454030a145b3553132a67d). Apologies for the poor sound quality.

## Inspiration

Having worked in the design field for many years, I know firsthand how frustrating it can be to keep track of the various pieces needed for one project, let alone multiple projects. A dedicated "workspace" would be very helpful.

As a side goal, from the start of my Flatiron life, I wanted to connect each phase project into one big Phase 5 capstone project. To be honest, I thought it would make the final project a little easier, but not sure it actually did. But I did find it helpful to stick to my design tool theme when planning out all the phase projects.
